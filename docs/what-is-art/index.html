  <p>What is art? While a simple question, it is a controversial topic in modern philosophy. This essay explores difficulties in defining art, and presents case studies involving plants to highlight the difficulties. I will raise more questions than I answer.</p>
<h2 id="difficulties-in-defining-art">Difficulties in defining art</h2>
<p>Adajian describes ten constraints on definitions of art (Adajian). We focus on three of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Traditionally, artworks are intentionally endowed by their makers with properties, often sensory, having a significant degree of aesthetic interest, usually surpassing that of most everyday objects.</li>
<li>The arts are always changing, just as the rest of culture is: as artists experiment creatively, new genres, art-forms, and styles develop; standards of taste and sensibilities evolve; understandings of aesthetic properties, aesthetic experience, and the nature of art evolve.</li>
<li>Lots of things besides artworks – for example, natural entities (sunsets, landscapes, flowers, shadows), human beings, and abstract entities (theories, proofs, mathematical entities) – have interesting aesthetic properties.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will consider these difficulties in defining art to highlight gray areas of what we consider art.</p>

<h2 id="case-studies">Case studies</h2>
<p><img src="still_life.jpg" alt="alt">
Clara Peeters, A Bouquet of Flowers, 1612. Oil on canvas. New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>Consider the presented difficulties.</p>
<ol>
<li>The painting of the bouquet is undoubtably significantly more aesthetic than every day objects.</li>
<li>Still lives are an entire type of artwork, especially popular during the 17th century in modern day Netherlands. There is a long tradition of still lives and they are still found in modern works (such as the 2014 Kerry James Marshall painting we saw at The Metropolitan Museum of Art)</li>
<li>Not applicable.</li>
</ol>
<p>This still life easily addresses all three difficulties, and we even analyzed this still life in class. It is hard to argue this isn&rsquo;t art, I even saw it at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p><img src="bouquet.jpg" alt="alt">
Apple Tree Market, Bouquet, 2024. New York, Apple Tree Market.</p>
<p>Consider the presented difficulties.</p>
<ol>
<li>The bouquet is undoubtably significantly more aesthetic than every day objects, at least while the flowers are healthy.</li>
<li>Bouquets, and arranging flowers more generally, have a long tradition in romantic contexts, spiritual contexts, and more.</li>
<li>While bouquets contain natural flowers, they are arranged in specific ways by humans, so one can argue the fall under typical artwork.</li>
</ol>
<p>This bouquet addresses difficulties 1 and 2, but difficulty 3 is slightly more unclear. Would a bouquet commonly be considered artwork? Is it adequately aesthetic and does it require enough human effort to make it art?</p>

Sydenham Teak Edwards, Syringa Vulgaris-Common Lilac, 1787. Hand colored, engraved prints. William Curtis Botanical Magazine 1st Edition Prints Vol 1-6.</p>
<p><img src="my_botanical_drawing.jpg" alt="alt">
Berkan Ottlik, Lilac drawing, 2024. Pencil on paper. New York City.</p>
<p>Consider the presented difficulties.</p>
<ol>
<li>While the botanical drawing is aesthetic, the artist presumably did not intentionally make it aesthetic, rather the plant of interest is by itself aesthetic.</li>
<li>There is a rich history of botanical drawings. However, these seem to be considered as science not art.</li>
<li>If drawings are automatically considered artwork, then this difficulty is not applicable. Otherwise, the consideration is similar to difficulty 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of the difficulties are easily resolved. The key issue is that while the drawing is aesthetic, it is not drawn to be aesthetic.</p>
<p><img src="lilac.jpg" alt="alt">
Lilac. New York Botanicsl Garden.</p>
<p>Consider the presented difficulties.</p>
<ol>
<li>I photographed this lilac tree in the New York Botanical Garden. Here, it clearly had a maker who placed somewhere to look aesthetic. Simply considering a lilac flower in a vaccum, the flower is aesthetic, yet it lacks a human maker.</li>
<li>Lilac flowers are long considered aesthetic and found in many gardens, however they are typically not by themselves considered art or found in art museums.</li>
<li>The lilac flower perfectly exemplifies this difficulty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, none of the difficulties are easily resolved. Considering the tree in a botanical garden constructed by humans, it seems easier to resolve these difficulties. But perhaps its intrinsic aesthetic is sufficient for it to be part.</p>
