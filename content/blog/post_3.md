Finer brush strokes used for the people and the still life.

Plants create depth in the scene

Plants provide cover

Pose of the man on the left similar to Adam in The Creation of Adam my Michaelangelo. 

Branches and trunks open up in the back and invite the outside world to look at the bather in the back. She is also clothed in all white, appears very innocent, away from the men, and is next to younger trees.

Scene in the front is surrounded by larger trees, providing more cover. 

Thick brushstrokes in the leaves and trees pushes attention away from them and towards the central figures.

Little bird in the top center of the image.

Privacy in the front almost creates a more mischevious attmosphere, as if she were a stripper, strippers wouldn't do that in public, but the woman in the back is more public

only leaves with any detail are the ones in the still life, act similar to a plate

Trees act similar to walls, open door and plate
