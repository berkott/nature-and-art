There is one

Focus on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQd0 and do a formal analysis 

On the surface, yes, The Joy of Painting is designed so folks can dabble along from home. But it's a rare fan who's squeezed out a tube of Prussian Blue. Ross knew it. As he told the Orlando Sentinel in 1990: "The majority of our audience does not paint, has no desire to paint, will never paint." Instead, the show's appeal is more abstract. It's less about the art lesson, and more about the mood: cozy, nurturing — an audio-visual pat on the back, coaxing the audience to try something new. For 22 minutes, at least, there's no fear of failure. As Ross used to say, "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents."

The town of 10,000 is known for its local distillery and is a short drive from the headquarters of Bob Ross Inc., which still coordinates community art programmes. It was in this area that Ross was ‘discovered’ some 40 years ago, then a student of Bill Alexander, to whom he attributes the ‘wet-on-wet’ method of rapidly applying layers of oil pigment to a gessoed canvas during a brief window of time. There’s something impressionistic about this approach, working as it does to approximate rustic scenes in a picturesque mode. But where the impressionists relied on external perception, Ross’s signature move was to work indoors, tapping into the mind’s eye, encouraging the viewer at home to paint along and improvise. As one quote on the wall text at Franklin Park reminds viewers, ‘Painting is an individual thing. Each of us sees nature through different eyes.’
