Dividing the artwork into several levels:
1. Flat plain at the bottom with trees
The bottom depicts a native american tribe (what tribe). All of the natives are engaged in immediate affairs with animals they hunted, fabrics, talking, or on horses, with the exception of two individuals by the lake, looking up at the vast peak. All of the natives are dwarfed by the trees beside them (use of trees), let alone the vast mountains beyond. 

Lake seperates all of the natives from the mountains, all the two can do is look on

2. Middle rocky terrain
The middle terrain appears rather lifeess and the trees are more barren and dead (use of trees), almost more like an obstacle than a habitable zone.

Waterfall and steep banks make it seem insurmountable. Then another plane of existence, but after that also very difficult to rise up
3. Upper alpine peaks
Occupy almost half of the image and dominate everything around them, while he uses an atmospheric perspective, the mountain is huge and detail is not lost, the mountain even appears to be towering over the clouds.

Layering of the mountains makes it appear as though they may continue forever and go and go.

Use of light:

Bierstadt makes intricate use of light. He highlights the teepees in the back, the waterfall, and the mountain in the distance.

Middle region darker, as more of an obstacle again

The illumination of the waterfall in th center of the image naturally catches the eye, and the upwards light combined with the glacier, in addition to the convergence of the landscape to the waterfall and straight up to the peak, naturally lead the viewers eyes to the peak of the image.

Funny detail, chipmunk at the bottom left.

Peaks of the teepees mirror those of the mountains beyond
