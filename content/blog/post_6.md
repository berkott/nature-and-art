Rock garden at the Bronx Botanical garden

Gardens are certainly art. We consider the back area in the rock garden of the New York Botanical Garden. 

Gardens as art.
- Plants are constantly changing and growing and different in seasons
- We walk though them and see them at many different angles
- Lighting constantly changes

Analyzing the rock garden in the spring.
- large trees around make for an oasis inside.
- Water does smth
- Different plant choices integral
- Rocks and the path are the only permanent things, they create the structure and shape of the garden.
- Outpost in the back created by bushes and tree and yuca tree. 
- Elongated oval shape allows for viewing of all plants, even the ones in the middle.
- Colors of the flowers and choice of flowers that spread on the ground. 
- Carpet the whole ground in front, more exposed soil in the back. More fertile versus more mature with colors versus not.
