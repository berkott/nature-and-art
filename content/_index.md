# Nature and Art

While art can create fantasy worlds detached from reality, art is never completely detached from nature. Much art directly depicts aspects of nature, many mediums are limited by natural processes, and at the very least, human perfeption is greatly influenced by nature.

This website explores topics involving both natural objects and art. The subject matters include analyses of painting depicting trees and other natural objects, investigations into the art making materials, and philosophical questions about the definition of art.
